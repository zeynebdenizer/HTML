This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
All the images used in the game are included within the project file.

The player competes against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors through clickable buttons. 
Each time someone wins, their score increases by one.

I created this game easily by following the tutorial video linked below:

Thanks to the help of this video and artificial intelligence tools, I was able to understand the concepts quickly and build the game smoothly.
Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
