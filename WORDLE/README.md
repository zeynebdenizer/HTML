This is a simple Wordle game project built with basic HTML. The game highlights letters with two colors to provide feedback: letters that are correctly placed turn green, while letters that exist in the word but are in the wrong position turn yellow. The implementation focuses on fundamental concepts and practical application, making it suitable for beginners.

The word list used in this project consists of Turkish words stored in memory, specifically excluding those containing dotted vowels (such as "i" and "Ã¼") to simplify processing.

The development of this project was inspired and guided by the tutorial available at this YouTube video, which proved to be an effective resource for understanding the core mechanics of Wordle-like games.
