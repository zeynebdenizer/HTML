This Wordle clone features a clean and user-friendly layout. At the top, a bold and centered title reads "Wordle." Below it, a 6-row by 5-column grid is displayed at the center of the screen. Each tile is a square with a light gray border, designed to display the letters entered by the player.

As the player types, letters appear in the tiles from left to right. After each full guess, the tiles change color based on accuracy:
Green indicates the correct letter in the correct position.
Yellow shows the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
Gray means the letter is not in the word.

Once the game is over — either the correct word is guessed or all attempts are used — a message appears below the board showing the result. The interface is minimal, centered, and closely resembles the original Wordle game in both style and interaction.
The word list used in this project consists of Turkish words stored in memory, specifically excluding those containing dotted vowels (such as "i" and "ü") to simplify processing.

The development of this project was inspired and guided by the tutorial available at this YouTube video, which proved to be an effective resource for understanding the core mechanics of Wordle-like games:
